Kami Tools

**My Collection of Awesome Tools/Websites.** However, some of them are only compatible with macOS .

**Why "Kami"?:** The term "kami" in Japanese can be translated as "god". When utilizing these incredible tools, one may feel as though a divine force is aiding them. I use this term to convey my profound gratitude.

**Attention:** We should master our tools, not become slaves to them. (否则，将是另外一种 "差生文具多".)
